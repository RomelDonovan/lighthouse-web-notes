### Tips

The `console.assert()` method writes an error message to the console if the assertion is false. If the assertion is true, nothing happens.

#### Example

The following code example demonstrates the use of a JavaScript object following the assertion:

```javascript
const errorMsg = "the # is not even";
for (let number = 2; number <= 5; number++) {
  console.log(`the # is ${number}`);
  console.assert(number % 2 === 0, "%o", { number, errorMsg });
}
// output:
// the # is 2
// the # is 3
// Assertion failed: {number: 3, errorMsg: "the # is not even"}
// the # is 4
// the # is 5
// Assertion failed: {number: 5, errorMsg: "the # is not even"}

```
