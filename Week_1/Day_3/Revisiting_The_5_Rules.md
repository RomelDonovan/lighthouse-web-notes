### Tips

### Ask for Help
if you are stuck for 15 minutes or more, it's time to hit the Request Assistance button. If you know that you're the type of person who likes to figure things out on your own, just remember: mentors are not only here to help you on what you don't understand, but they are also here to teach you how to approach problems and how to think as a developer: things that you will sorely miss out on if you aren't asking for help.

### Take breaks
you now know that Bootcamp is challenging and all-consuming, but it's important to remember that bootcamp is a marathon, not a sprint. Go for walks, stretch, doodle, meditateâ€¦ research has shown that mental breaks can boost retention, increase productivity, replenish focus, and encourage creativity.

### Don't Compare Yourself to Others
by now you've probably noticed that this is arguably the most difficult rule to follow because we are all human. Therefore it bears repeating that the only standard that you will be measured against is ours, and the only person you need to be better than is yourself yesterday. If you find yourself comparing yourself to others, remember that while they may be excelling this week, it could be your turn to excel next week. Instead of comparing yourself to others, work together, collaborate, and pull each other up as a cohort.
